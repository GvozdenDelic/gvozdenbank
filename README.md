# gvozdenbank

This is a demo fullstack aplication in Java (Spring Boot) and React.js where we have User and BankAccount entities.
It is possible to create, delete and search users. Bank accounts can be created, deleted, searched and also have deposit and withdraw options.

The project is currently in progress with following planned features:
- Frontend design
- Frontend implementation using React.js with Typescript, Redux Toolkit and React Router
- Unit testing with Jest (TDD approach)
- Support for multiple bank account types
- Improved bank account service layer logic, so only bankers can create and delete bank accounts
- Live demo
